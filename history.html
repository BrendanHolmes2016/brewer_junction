			<p>Brewer Junction was founded by settlers in 1756. We got our name in 1919 during the probihition. Brewer Junction is very well known in the area for our many brewerys. At one point in our history we had five in our small town and we are now currently down to three. Brewer Junction has had many awards.</p>
			<p>We still have houses and buildings in our town square that were built in 1756. We have great architecture all throughout town everywhere you turn.
